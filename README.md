# Robust-functional-linear-regression
Robust penalized estimators for the functional linear model. 
The main function m.pen.sp is in the directory named "Main function (MM P-splines)".
This function implements the MM P-spline estimator used in Kalogridis and Van Aelst (2021).
The implementation uses an initial unpenalized S-estimator and then the penalized variant of IRLS in order to obtain the MM-estimator.
Contact me at ioannis.kalogridis@kuleuven.be for remarks and/or suggestions.

Here is an example.
